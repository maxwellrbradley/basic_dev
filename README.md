## About
I keep my vimrc and tmux configuration files in this repo. Really good if you're a command line developer (like me).

Vim
======
This is my standard configuration for the vim that I run on my laptop. Some links for plugins that I use.
`https://github.com/Chiel92/vim-autoformat` for autoformatting
`https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe` for autocomplete
Tmux
======
This is a file that configures tmux to perform like vim. Note: a friend of mine made this, I just use it.
Note that I run tmux3.0a.
